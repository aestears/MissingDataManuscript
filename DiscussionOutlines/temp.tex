\subsection*{Times series with Gaussian error} 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comparison of parameter recovery across different methods (simulated dataset) and the implications 
        \item Explain why data augmentation and Kalman filter had better performance. 
        \item Parameter estimates vs mean standardized estimates for $\phi$ (Tradeoffs) at different levels of missingness
    \item Comparison of estimation error (uncertainty) from different methods (real data): What did we learn?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Data augmentation and Kalman filter won the battle here again, indicating the consistency of these approaches in handling missing data. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Impact of autocorrelation levels on MNAR dataset}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Comparison of parameter recovery across different methods (simulated dataset) and the implications.
    \item Comparison of estimation error (uncertainty) from different methods (real data): What insights did we get from the analysis?
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Time Series with Poisson error}



\subsection*{Small sample size bias}
Longer time series of population data can be difficult to obtain and therefore often relative to other types of data sets, the sample size can be small (<100)
$phi$ 

\begin{equation}
    Y_t = {\bf x}_t'{\bm \beta} + \phi \times (Y_{t-1} - {\bf x}_{t-1}'{\bm \beta}) + \varepsilon_t
\label{eq:ar1}
\end{equation}
